The "BY GAME" column lists whether the game can be relied upon to identify the 
type of wand when it is zapped when not suffering from any ailments (blindness, 
confusion, etc.). It may not be accurate under exceptional circumstances (for 
instance, a wand of create monster is only identified if something is summoned 
by it), but I haven't attempted to determine the scope of this.

Notes

When zapping at something is referred to, it means to zap in the direction
of something which must be no more than 6 squares away from the player to be
certain of correct identification.

Wands with 0 charges will not normally be identified by zapping. Such wands
will usually give the message "Nothing happens." without prompting for a
direction, only doing anything to identify their type 1/121 of the time,
which will zap the wand once and destroy it in the process. You should not 
confuse it with a wand of secret door detection, which gives no message when 
zapped.


Safety

When zapping an unidentified wand, it is important to ensure that the wand
does not hit anything it was not intended to hit.

This can be acchieved by zapping the wand somewhere where you can see a 
distance of at least 13 squares (the maximum range of a wand), where you can 
see every square between you and a wall at least 7 squares away towards a wall 
you can see when you have reflection, or towards a door.

This range is not correct for wands of digging, but fortunately the only 
problem that can result directly from this is zapping it into a shop. This can 
be avoided by always zapping towards an area you have already explored.

You should not zap a wand towards a monster unless you know that it isn't a
wand of polymorph as it may turn into something you are ill-equipped to deal 
with.

If you do not have reflection yourself, you should avoid zapping wands which 
could have the "RAY" type towards monsters which are reflective or have hands 
to hold a shield of reflection with unless you are far enough away for a 
reflected ray to not hit you.

You should not zap an unidentified wand towards a dangerous monster unless you 
know that it isn't a wand of speed monster, create monster, or make invisible 
(unless you can see invisible). You should avoid this in general anyway, as
high level monsters are often capable of resisting wands zapped at them.

You should not zap an unidentified wand in the direction of a shop unless you 
either know that it isn't a wand of digging or are willing to deal with an
angry shopkeeper.

Practical wand identification

I find it useful to zap a wand as soon as it is safe to do so in the knowledge 
that most of the special identification conditions are only needed for a small 
number of wand types. I do try to be prepared, though, and therefore carry
something I can visibly cancel and a corpse with me from the moment I find
them for this purpose. If there's a chest or large box nearby, I'll use that
to test wands of opening, locking and probing. If not, I'll use a convenient
(preferably locked) door instead, 

I've included a checklist of the things that need to be checked to identify a 
wand conclusively. I tend to make a copy of this list in a text document, but 
it would be almost as easy to name the wand YNNYYYN or something instead.

type      zap   probe open  lock  canc' unde' mons' 
caesium   Y     N     Y     N     Y     Y     N

Just in case the names aren't too clear, these mean:
zap   The wand has been zapped.
probe The wand has been zapped at something it could probe (a monster or a
      container with contents).
open  The wand has been zapped at an open box/door or a box with a broken lock.
lock  The wand has been zapped at a locked box/door or a box with a broken lock.
canc' The wand has been zapped at something which can be noticeably cancelled.
unde' The wand has been zapped at a monster/corpse.
mons' The wand has been zapped at a monster.

Open and lock can, of course, be switched if it makes more sense to you like 
that, and you should feel free to ignore those checks which only matter for 
wands which have already been identified.

It is worth noting that, if every check apart from the "mons'" one has failed, 
engraving something on the ground and then attempting to engrave with the wand 
will uniquely identify the wand. It is possible to engrave before the other 
checks, but this may waste a charge.

Cancellation

Full details on cancellation are available elsewhere. I'll simply mention a few 
good and bad things to use to test for this particular wand:

Good things include:
1. Things you've discovered to be blessed or cursed on an altar.
2. Things you've discovered to not be uncursed +0 items through identify 
   scrolls or being part of your initial inventory.
3. Items which you have tried on and found to be enchanted or cursed (you must 
   have removed cured items somehow, of course).
4. Weapons which have welded to the hand of a monster.
5. Stackable weapons (daggers, darts, arrows and crossbow bolts) which are 
   described identically but don't stack.
6. Items which your pet will only walk on reluctantly.

Bad things include:
1. Wands, bags of tricks, magic markers, and magic horns, harps, drums and 
   bells (you will lose charges from something potentially useful).
2. Books or scrolls, as cancellation will usually blank them (which may be 
   useful), and fire may destroy them (which probably won't).
3. Potions, as cancellation does not affect booze, fruit juice or oil 
   (important if unidentified), and striking will destroy potions.
4. Yourself. You can't zap the wand at items on the ground at the same time,
   and many wands won't be identified by this method. And irradiating yourself
   with pure energy may be somewhat unpleasant.
5. And, of course, anything you like and wouldn't like to see polymorphed into 
   something else (unless you've identified polymorph) or cancelled.
