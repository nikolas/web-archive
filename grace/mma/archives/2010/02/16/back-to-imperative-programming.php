	<h1>16/2/10, 1:06 pm -- Back to imperative programming</h1>
	<p>
	After being thoroughly uninspired by <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Reactive/Tutorial/A_FPS_display">a tutorial on Reactive that I could barely understand</a>, I'm returning to the imperative world with Raincat. I've been itching to start programming my project, and learning logical GUI programming hasn't been moving me forward. Maybe I'll come back to that after I have a working prototype.
