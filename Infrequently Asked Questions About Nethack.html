<h1>Infrequently Asked Questions About Nethack</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This page is a repository for notes on some of the more intriguing and
obscure topics which occasionally come up on <a href="news:rec.games.roguelike.nethack">rec.games.roguelike.nethack</a>.
If you're a newbie, you should probably look elsewhere; there are
spoilers here, but nothing that is likely to help you ascend.  Most of
what is discussed on this page applies to both Nethack and Slash'EM,
and I shall indicate differences where I am aware of them.

<h3>Taming The Riders</h3>
There has been some interest in taming the endgame Riders,
apparently sparked off by the story of <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&safe=off&th=fc981c7c3d73855f,15&rnum=1&selm=3B30D928.B600EB2E%40web.de">Patito
the pacifist Gnomish Healer</a> who ascended with a pet Pestilence.
<p>
There is nothing intrinsically untameable about the Riders, unlike the
Wizard of Yendor or Demogorgon, neither of whom can be tamed under any
circumstances.  (See my <a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/slashem/pets.html">spoiler on tame
monsters</a> for a complete list of untameable monsters.)  However,
they are very difficult to tame because they are level 30 and have
100% magic resistance.  This means that they will resist any attempt
to tame them with a scroll of taming, spell of charm monster or magic
harp, or with the revivification technique available to high-level
Healers in Slash'EM.  The ``You feel charismatic!'' effect of a magic
trap ignores the target's magic resistance, but sadly there are no
magic traps on the Astral Plane.
</p><p>
Famine and Pestilence can be tamed by draining some levels from them
and then repeatedly casting charm monster.  Slash'EM Healers can
employ the somewhat easier approach of level-draining them until the
charm monster spell would have a non-zero chance of working (one level
drain is enough if you're level 30), then killing them and
resurrecting them with the revivification technique.  Death is immune
to level drain, and hence cannot be tamed in this way.  In Slash'EM,
it used to be trivial for a Healer to tame all three Riders by
reviving them, but this was considered a bug and has now been fixed.
</p><p>
If the Riders are polymorphed, they will lose their 100% magic
resistance and potentially become tameable.  They will always resist
the wand, potion or spell of polymorph, but if you polymorph into a
green slime, you can slime them.  This approach is not particularly
useful, as all you will get is a tame green slime which was once
Death, and since monster polymorph is always permanent in vanilla
Nethack, there is no way to tame Death.  In Slash'EM, however, you can
polymorph into a genetic engineer and hit Death causing her to
"undergo a freakish metamorphosis".  This is a temporary polymorph,
and if you tame Death while she is polymorphed she will remain tame
when she reverts.
</p><p>

<a name="wishes"></a>
</p><h3>Refusing Wishes</h3>
Sometimes people who are attempting the wishless challenge find an
unidentified wand, test it by engraving or zapping, and discover that
it's a wand of wishing.  They then wonder what they can do to avoid
breaking their conduct.
<p>
The answer to this question is highly dependent on the version of
Nethack you are playing (or, if you are playing Slash'EM, the version
of Nethack it is based on).
</p><ul>
<li>In Nethack 3.4.*, wishing for ``nothing'' enables you to refuse a
wish and keep your wishless conduct.  You can also genocide ``none''
to retain genocideless conduct instead of typing an invalid monster
name or class five times.
</li><li>In 3.3.1, there was no way to refuse a wish.  You just had
to wish for an iron chain (the canonical useless item), and know that
you did not gain anything from the wish which was inflicted on you.
</li><li>In 3.3.0, wishing for gold did not count as a wish.
</li><li>In 3.2.2 and earlier, the game did not track conducts.  Wishing
for your own quest artifact would probably have been a good choice,
since you wouldn't have received anything.  (It's no longer a good
choice because it breaks the ``no artifact wishes'' conduct.)
</li></ul>
<p>

<a name="survive"></a>
</p><h3>Surviving Indefinitely</h3>
Is it possible for a Nethack character to live infinitely long?  This
question does not refer to ascension or to explore mode or wizard
mode, but to a normal game lasting for infinitely many turns.  After a
long and interesting <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/b492d52207e341ed/758f169d527c081c" title="discussion about surviving indefinitely in Nethack">discussion</a>,
it was discovered that this is indeed possible.  However, it
became more difficult in Nethack 3.4.1, as it is no longer possible to
gain the unchanging intrinsic by eating an amulet of unchanging.
(Thanks to Ben Yee for pointing this out.)
<p>
There are two factors which must be kept under control when attempting
this challenge: hit points and nutrition.  If either of those becomes
too low, you die.  Of course, there are ways to die that don't involve
running out of hit points or nutrition, but these are relatively easy
to avoid and prove that you are avoiding.
</p><p>
Since there is no way to generate an infinite supply of healing
potions, the only practical strategy for keeping your hit points up is
to ensure that nothing can reduce them.  The psychic blasts of
(master) mind flayers can only be defended against by genociding them.
</p><p>
You also have to protect yourself against both melee attacks and
ranged attacks.  One way to do this is to reverse genocide blue
jellies (or some other sessile monster), so that you are surrounded by
eight of them, and then read a scroll of earth, so that there are also
eight boulders on the squares surrounding you.  You may need to repeat
this procedure if some of the jellies are killed when you read the
scroll of earth.  Monsters can't see you through the wall of boulders,
so won't attack you from afar, and even monsters that could dig,
phase, or pick up the boulders won't be able to get next to you while
the jellies are there.  Aaron Ranta has done
this in wizard mode in version 3.3.1, and has placed a <a href="http://www.iphc.washington.edu/staff/aaron/NHStressTest.jpg" title="snapshot of an immortal character">snapshot of his game</a> on
the Web.
</p><p>
Now that you cannot gain the unchanging intrinsic, it is difficult to
eliminate the need to eat.  Wearing the amulet is not sufficient,
because it will cause you to consume food at the rate of one nutrition
point per 20 turns.
Relying on eating monster corpses works wonderfully in a real game,
but not in this theoretical discussion.  For one thing, perhaps no
monsters will be generated for a very long time.  For another, when
you live on monster corpses you have to kill the monsters and take the
risk of them killing you.
</p><p>
There is a tedious strategy involving wearing two rings of slow
digestion, and repeatedly removing one or the other ring to avoid its
``ring hunger'' effect, but always keeping at least one ring on to avoid
normal food consumption.
However, it is simpler to survive indefinitely by praying for food.  When you
pray successfully, your prayer timeout is set to rnz(350), assuming
that you have neither been crowned nor killed the Wizard.  rnz(i) can
never be any more than 20 times i, so your prayer timeout cannot be
any more than 7000.
</p><p>
If you pray successfully while starving, your nutrition level is set
to 900.  Assuming that you only consume one nutrition point every 20
turns (e.g., you are either a human wearing a ring of slow digestion
or a xorn wearing an amulet of unchanging), it will take 18000 turns
for your nutrition level to reach 0 (Fainting).  This is more than
enough time to ensure that you will be able to pray.
</p><p>
This strategy requires you to avoid being crowned, but as of version
3.4.1, you will never receive a favour for praying while in trouble
and not on an altar, so this isn't a problem.

</p><h3>Public Machine More Difficult?</h3>
There was once an interesting discussion on playing on a
single-user system versus playing on a multi-user system.  Clearly,
the difference is that on a multi-user system you can find other
people's bones files.
<p>
Here are some notes on how bones files work:
</p><ul>
<li>There can only be one bones file per dungeon level on the system
(and there are some levels on which bones cannot be left).
</li><li>When you arrive at a new level, there is a 1/3 chance of loading a
bones file if there is one for that level on the system.
</li><li>When you die, the probability that you leave a bones file is
dependent on your dungeon level.  In vanilla Nethack, you are more
likely to leave bones at higher (deeper) levels, but in Slash'EM, you
are more likely to leave bones at lower levels.
</li></ul>
<p>
Is the number of bones files seen by a typical user in a typical game
any greater on a multi-user system?  The answer turns out to be: only
if the users on the multi-user system are at differing levels of
skill.  If they are all at the same skill level and not improving over
time, then the only relevant difference between the two systems is
that more Nethack is being played on the multi-user system.
</p><p>
So what happens to the number of bones files on the system over time?
Well, the number of bones files loaded (and hence removed from the
system) in a typical game must increase with the number of bones files
on the system.  The probability of leaving a bones file in a typical
game decreases if there are more bones files on the system - the
average level reached before dying is the same (to a first
approximation), but sometimes it won't be possible to leave bones
because there is already a bones file for that level.
</p><p>
Therefore the more bones files there are on the system, the more are
consumed and the fewer are created.  Hence the number of bones files
does not increase constantly over time, but reaches a steady state
which is dependent on the average skill level but not the number of
users.  If the number of bones files on the system is the same on the
single-user and multi-user machines, then the number of bones files
seen during a typical game must also be the same.
</p><p>
On a system with varying skill levels, though, experts are likely to
find more bones than they leave.  Perhaps the easiest way to see this
is to take an extreme case.  If you are so expert that you ascend all
the time, then on a single-user system you'll never leave or find
bones.  On a multi-user system, you'll still never leave bones, but
there will be plenty there for you to find.  If experts find more
bones, newbies must find fewer (since the total number of bones files
remains approximately stable).
</p><p>
Do bones files make the game easier or harder?  On the one hand, you
get to use or sell all the equipment in the bones pile (although it
will mostly be cursed), but on the other hand, you have to watch out
for whatever killed the former player.  If the cause of death was a
classic <acronym title="Yet Another Stupid Death">YASD</acronym> like
hitting a floating eye, then there's no problem.  If
it involved being ambushed by hordes of monsters, that is slightly
tougher, but the hordes could have turned up on a new level at that
depth too, and if the former player eliminated some of the hordes
before dying, you are better off than if you were facing a brand-new
pack.  Problems arise when the original cause of death was something
like ``gnome with a wand of death'' or ``wimpy hostile monster got lucky
with a polymorph trap'' or ``player tried to genocide master liches with
a cursed scroll'', or the former player had powerful pets.
</p><p>
Finally, on a multi-user system the bones files are going to be more
varied and therefore more useful.  If you stick to playing one class,
there won't be much variety in the bones left on your own system, but
on a multi-user system you'll find bones piles left by other classes
with different equipment.  Newbies on a multi-user system also have
the chance of finding a bones pile left by an expert who suffered YASD
with most of an ascension kit.

</p><h3>A Nethack Wish In Real Life</h3>
If you could have one Nethack wish in real life, what would you wish
for?  This question has appeared on the newsgroup a couple of times.
I'd wish for holy water, because drinking it cures sickness, and
once you have one potion, you can make more by dipping ordinary water
in it.  The only snag is that if you are chaotic, drinking holy water
will burn you, and it is not clear what is meant by "chaotic" in
Nethack.  If you suspect you might be chaotic, it is safer to wish for
a blessed unicorn horn.  I have a separate page with <a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~eva/nethack/wishirl.html" title="more on Nethack wishes in real life">more
discussion of this topic</a>.
